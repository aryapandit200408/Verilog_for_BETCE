# Verilog_for_BETCE
This is a repository that will help you get started with Verilog. This manual has been designed to be done alongside Prof. Mrinal Kanti Naskar Sir's Digital 1 and 2 Lab. 
This would be very helpful for those who want to move forward in the digital electronics domain for research and jobs. 



### Prerequisites
1. You will need to learn the fundamentals of digital circuits. Digital Design by Morris Mano (Verilog and System Verilog Language included) Version should be used a reference.

2. If you wish to brush up your concepts through YouTube videos, you can use [playlist 1]() or [playlist 2]()


### Getting Started 
#### 1. Verilog using Vivado
This is perhaps the easiest way to get started since the UI is very easy and you can directly code FPGAs after synthesis and implementation. 
Head over to the Vivado Download page and install. [link](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html)
